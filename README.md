<p>Pipelight - Tiny automation pipelines.</p>
</h1>
</span>

Automate your most boring and repetitive tasks.

## 📦 A lightweight tool for CICD

Pipelight is a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) based small(13Mb) cli tool to
be used from inside a terminal.

- Define pipelines using **toml, hcl, yaml, typescript**.
- Trigger on events: git hooks, file changes...

Checkout the [Documentation](https://pipelight.dev) for a much friendlier approach
and a deeper understanding.

## Usage example

![pipelight_demo](https://github.com/pipelight/doc.pipelight/blob/master/public/tapes/gifs/demo.gif)

## Define pipelines with a configuration language

Fold your bash commands into an object `Pipeline{ Step{ Command }}`.

Use your preferred configuration languages for your most simple pipelines.

- Toml

  ```toml
  [[pipelines]]
  name = "test"

  [[pipelines.steps]]
  name = "build"
  commands = ["pnpm install", "pnpm build"]

  [[pipelines.triggers]]
  branches = ["master","dev"]
  actions= ["pre-push", "pre-commit"]
  ```

- Hcl

  ```hcl
  # A pipeline
  pipelines = [{
    name = "test"
    steps = [{
      name     = "build"
      commands = ["pnpm install", "pnpm build"]
    }]
    triggers = [{
      branches = ["master","dev"]
      actions  = ["pre-push", "pre-commit"]
    }]
  }]
  ```

- Yaml

  ```yml
  pipelines:
    - name: test
      steps:
        - name: build
          commands:
            - pnpm install
            - pnpm build
    - triggers:
        - branches:
            - master
            - dev
          actions:
            - pre-push
            - pre-commit
  ```

## Define pipelines with a programming language.

Fold your bash commands into an object `Pipeline{ Step{ Command }}`.

As long as you know javascript,
you are ready to go with your favorite syntax flavor.

- Javascript. Use a verbose and declarative syntax.

  ```js
  const my_pipeline = {
    name: "build_my_website",
    steps: [
      {
        name: "clean directory",
        commands: ["rm -rf ./dist"],
      },
      {
        name: "build",
        commands: ["pnpm install", "pnpm lint", "pnpm build"],
      },
    ],
  };
  ```

- Typescript(with Helpers). Use the provided sweet shorthands.

  ```ts
  const my_pipeline = pipeline("build website", () => [
    step("clean directory", () => [`rm -rf ${build_dir}`]),
    step("build", () => ["pnpm install", "pnpm lint", "pnpm build"]),
    step("send to host", () => [`scp -r ${build_dir}`]),
    step("do stuffs on host", () => [
      ssh("host", () => ["systemctl restart nginx"]),
    ]),
  ]);
  ```

## 🤖 Automatic triggers

Add automatic triggers to your pipeline.

_If you want to run tests on file change or deploy to production on push to master._

```sh
# enable watcher and git hooks.
pipelight enable git-hooks
pipelight enable watcher
```

```toml
[[pipelines.triggers]]
branches = ["master"]
actions = ["pre-push"]
```

## 🫦 Pretty and verbose logs

Get the pipeline most relevant informations or dive into the steps and commands
standard outputs.

Get the pipeline status, event, execution time... and more.

```sh
pipelight logs
```

Get a tranparent outputs of every subprocesses.

```sh
pipelight logs -vvvv
```

## 🛠️ Install

Checkout the
[instruction guide](https://pipelight.dev/introduction/install.html) for your
favorite package manager.

## 🚀 Get started!

Create a default configuration file `pipelight.ts` in your project root
directory with:

```sh
pipelight init
```

Try the harmless default pipeline:

```sh
pipelight run
```

And explore logs:

```sh
pipelight logs -vvvv
```
